<h2>Part 1:</h2>
<h3><Team Members:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>John Mancini</li>
  <li>Qunchao Zhou</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Project Relevance:</h2>
<p>John's experience is in the python programming language and a high level understanding of neural networks. Qunchao's experience is in databases. Both team members will be new to the TensorFlow library and cloud computing with Google Collaboration.</p><br>
  
<h2>Goals and Milestones</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Train neural network to get >50% approximations (meaning over 50 percent of its approximations are correct according to test data)</li>
  <li>Train neural network to get >70% approximations</li>
  <li>Train neural network to get >80% approximations</li>
  <li>Store weights that get >80% approximations in database</li>
  <li>Create UI that is easy to use for most users.</li>
</ul>
<p>This will be an agile based software development process. We are going to work on the project in iterations, where in each iteration we add or enhance certain functionality</p>  

<h2>Work Plan:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>BOTH: Download dataset from kaggle.com</li>
  <li>BOTH: Get comfortable with TensorFlow API, perhaps by building smaller neural network</li>
  <li>BOTH: Get comfortable with google collaboration. This will be our cloud computing platform. It will make neural network calculations much faster.</li>
  <li>JOHN: Build neural network in TensorFlow until we achieve high 80% approximations for tweet mood.</li>
  <li>QUNCHAO: Store the weights that are giving us these approximations in a database</li>
  <li>BOTH: Learn how to do above in an efficient and effective way</li>
  <li>JOHN: Once we have a neural network that can fetch weights from a database that will give us good approximations, start building UI</li>
  <li>BOTH: Learn twitter API so that we can allow the user to submit a link and with that link we can analyze all of the tweets in a thread.</li>
  <li>QUNCHAO: Maybe add graphing capabilities so the user can see a visualization of the tweets they have analyzed.</li>
  <li>BOTH: Create power point and plan for presentation on what we have learned.</li>
  <li>BOTH: Plan a demonstration for the TA during the last lab to show them the project is fully functional and working.</li>
  <li>BOTH SEPERATELY: Write personal reflection on the project: What we learned, difficult bugs, how we learned, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>We plan to use an agile based software development strategy. From the work plan above, we want to build this project in iterations. First by learning how to build a neural network with tensorflow, then building the neural network, then storing the weights from a good neural network in a database, then building UI.</p>
