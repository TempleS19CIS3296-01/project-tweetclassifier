<h2>Part 1:</h2>
<h3><Team Members:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>John Mancini</li>
  <li>Qunchao Zhou</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Project Relevance:</h2>
<p>John's experience is in the python programming language and a high level understanding of neural networks. Qunchao's experience is in databases. Both team members will be new to the TensorFlow library and cloud computing with Google Collaboration.</p><br>
  
<h2>Goals and Milestones</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Download dataset from kaggle.com</li>
  <li>Get comftorable with TensorFlow API, perhaps by building smaller neural network</li>
  <li>Get comftorable with google colaboration. This will be our cloud computing platform. It will make neural network calculations much faster.</li>
  <li>Build neural network in TensorFlow until we achieve high 80% approximations for tweet mood.</li>
  <li>Store the weights that are giving us these approximations in a database</li>
  <li>Learn how to do above in an efficient and effective way</li>
  <li>Once we have a neural network that can fetch weights from a database that will give us good approximations, start building UI</li>
  <li>Learn twitter API so that we can allow the user to submit a link and with that link we can analyze all of the tweets in a thread.</li>
  <li>Maybe add graphing capabilities so the user can see a visualization of the tweets they have analyzed.</li>
</ul>
